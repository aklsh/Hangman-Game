# [Hangman](https://www.github.com/aklsh/Hangman-Game)

This is a python program that brings the word game ***Hangman*** to the terminal.

### Rules to play the game
---
If you have not played the game before, here are the rules:

1. Play individually or in groups. 
2. You will be provided with an unknown word, which has to be guessed. You will be provided with a hint for the word and also the number of letters in it.
2. Select a letter of the alphabet, which you think might be present.
3. If the letter is present in the word, continue to guess the rest of the letters. You will not be given a penalty (obviously lol).
4. If the letter isn't present in the word, you will get a penalty.
5. For each penalty, a letter be striked off from the word **HANGMAN**, till no letters remain in the word to be striked off. This will result in _LOSS_.
5. You can also get to guess the whole word, if you have an idea. If you guess it correctly, you _WIN_, else another penalty.
